= kinesis Docs App

Ultrasimple CMS and content for documentation of the kinesis platform.  The production site is at: http://docs.kinesis.com

If you'd like to propose an edit to the kinesis docs, fork this repo, then send us a pull request.

You can also use this as a basis for your own docs CMS.  Please don't use our colorscheme or images (which are not part of this repo).  A fresh checkout will run with a generic black-on-white scheme, which should serve as a good base for you to customize the look and feel.  The notes.png included in this repo is one exception, it was taken from the excellent AsciiDoc [http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/] project.
