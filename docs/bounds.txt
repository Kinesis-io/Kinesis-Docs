Bounds
======

Here we explain how we can bind a gesture to a specified area of the screen. 

This is required to specify the area where gesture tracking should be enabled. Only if the origin of a gesture is in the specified bounds, the gesture will be recognized. 


Let's consider two examples. Say there are two gestures with the following bounds specified (Values in percentage(%)):

    swipeGestureA.bounds      = {min: {x: 80, y: 0, z: 0}};
    
and 

    swipeGestureB.bounds      = {max: {x: 20, y: 0, z: 0}};
    

Visually, they would look like

<img src="./images/kinesis/bounds1.jpg" />

So, if swipeGestureA has the direction set as "left", then this is the case when it will work.

But, if the gesture is started outside the mentioned bounds, it will not be detected, and hence the callback function is not called.
