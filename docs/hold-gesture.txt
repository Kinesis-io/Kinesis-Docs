Simulate Mouse Click Via Hold Gesture
=====================================

Kinesis.io also allows us to very easily simulate ___'onclick'___ event via a hand hold gesture.

### Just add 'interactive' class to an element

To make an element interactive we simply need to use a class ___'interactive'___. 

When we hold our hand over any element with 'interactive' class, the 'onclick' event for its parent is fired.

Let me walk you through this with our demo ImageBox:

### Prerequisites

You have included the kinesis CSS, kinesis JS and initialized kinesis as outlines in the tutorials before.

### Demo

Here we have a bunch of images, each wrapped around an anchor tag which opens up the image as a modal window. We have used fancybox plugin for pop-ups.

    <div id="content">
      <a class="grouped_elements" rel="group1" href="images/1_b.jpg">
        <img src="images/1_b.jpg" alt="" class="interactive" />
      </a>
      <a class="grouped_elements" rel="group1" href="images/2_b.jpg">
        <img src="images/2_b.jpg" alt="" class="interactive"/>
      </a> 	
      <a class="grouped_elements" rel="group1" href="images/5_b.jpg">
        <img src="images/5_b.jpg" alt="" class="interactive"/>
      </a> 
      <a class="grouped_elements" rel="group1" href="images/4_b.jpg">
        <img src="images/4_b.jpg" alt="" class="interactive"/>
      </a>
    </div>

As you can see we have added 'interactive' class to all the images.

That's it!!!

Now, whenever you hold your hand over any image you can see a feedback circle loading and consequently the onclick for the link is fired and we see an image pop-up.

Now we have also made the fancybox close link to be interactive. To do this we did the following:

    $("a.grouped_elements").fancybox( {
      'onComplete' : function(){
        // gesturize the close link by inserting a interactive child inside the close link
        $("#fancybox-close").append("<label class='interactive'></label>"); 
      }
    }); // initialize fancybox
    
You can simply hold you hand over the close link to close the fancybox.
