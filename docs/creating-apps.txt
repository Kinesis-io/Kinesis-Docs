Creating apps
=============

The app is the fundamental unit of organization on Heroku. Each user can create
and manage multiple apps. When an app is created, a new [PostgreSQL
database](/database) is automatically allocated and the app runs with a single
[Dyno](/dynos). All apps can also take advantage of the [HTTP
cache](/http-caching).

### Creating an app with a specific name

To create a new app named "myapp", [install the heroku command line
tool](/heroku-command) and run the following command:

    :::term
    $ heroku create myapp
    Created http://myapp.heroku.com/ | git@heroku.com:myapp.git
    Git remote heroku added

The create command's output shows that the app will be available at
`http://myapp.heroku.com`. The second URL, `git@heroku.com:high-sunrise-58.git`,
is the remote git repository URL; the `heroku create` command automatically
adds a git remote named "heroku" pointing at this URL.

NOTE: After creating an app, you will probably want to <a href="/git">git push to
deploy</a> and <a href='/sharing'>add collaborators</a> so that others can deploy
changes as well.

### Creating an app with a generated name

The app name argument ("myapp") is optional. If no app name is specified, a
random generated name is used:

    :::term
    $ heroku create
    Created http://mystic-wind-83.heroku.com/ | git@heroku.com:mystic-wind-83.git

It's often easier to start with a default name and [rename the
app](/renaming-apps) later. Since Heroku app names are in a global namespace,
you can expect that common names, like "blog" or "wiki", will already be taken.

### Viewing app information

You can find out a variety of information about an app (such as the app's git
URL, registered domain names, repo size, etc.) using the `heroku info` command:

    :::term
    $ heroku info --app myapp
