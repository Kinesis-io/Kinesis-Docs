Gestures
========

Gesture Recognizer - This is used to define what all events should Kinesis JS SDK listen to in order to fire custom events 
This acts as the base class of all gesture classes.

You make instance variables, customize the gesture and then start recognizing them.

### SwipeGestureRecognizer 

Defining a new Swipe Gesture Recognizer



####Create swipe gesture

"mySwipeGesture" is any name given to the variable for your reference.

    var swipeGesture         = new SwipeGestureListener("mySwipeGesture");
  
     
####Callback

Call to action for swipe control
    
    swipeGesture.toFire      = swipeControl; //swipeControl is a callback method

####Direction

Allowed direction for gesture

    swipeGesture.directions  = [GestureDirections.GestureDirectionLeft];
    
The supported directions are

* GestureDirectionLeft
* GestureDirectionRight
* GestureDirectionUp
* GestureDirectionDown
        

####Joint

This is used to set the joints to be tracked for gesture

    swipeGesture.joints      = [JointTypes.JointTypeHandRight];
    
This is an array of joints, so if you want to track a swipe gesture with both left and right hands

    swipeGesture.joints      = [JointTypes.JointTypeHandRight, JointTypes.JointTypeHandLeft];

The joints which are currently used for Swipes are

* JointTypeHandRight
* JointTypeHandLeft
    
####Bounds (Optional)

This is required to specify the area where gesture tracking should be enabled. Only if the origin of a gesture is in the specified bounds, the gesture will be recognized. Values in percentage(%)
    
    swipeGesture.bounds      = {min: {x: 80, y: 0, z: 0}};
